# NVIDIA PhysX SDK 4.1

# Improved CMake integration (contributed by @phcerdan)
- Provide PhysXConfig.cmake and exported targets file for build and install tree.
- Other projects can use find_package(PhysX) where PhysX_DIR can be a build tree or an install tree.
- The implementation only adds two new CMakeLists.txt that do not collide with
the existing build procedure of Nvidia. Instead of using python and the generate_projects scripts, now it solely uses CMake in a standard way.
- This allows PhysX to be used with modern standards of CMake, making it compatible
   with FetchContent (add_subdirectory) and ExternalProject (find_package) commands.
- Snippets and Samples have not been integrated into the new build procedure.
- But added a simpler project to show find_package(PhysX) usage.
- The original build procedure is maintained compatible for easier integration with future upstream changes from NVidia.

## Example of CMake usage

# Build and optionally install PhysX with just CMake:
```bash
mkdir PhysX; cd PhysX
git clone https://github.com/phcerdan/PhysX src
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/tmp/physx ../src
ninja install
```

# Your project using PhysX (example added)

```cmake
find_package(PhysX REQUIRED)
add_executable(main main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(main PRIVATE PhysX::PhysXCommon PhysX::PhysXExtensions)
```

You can also use FetchContent, or ExternalProjects for handling PhysX automatically.

When building your project, just provide `PhysX_DIR` to where the PhysXConfig.cmake is located (it could be from a build or an install tree)
```bash
cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo -DPhysX_DIR:PATH=/tmp/physx/PhysX/bin/cmake/physx ../src
```

## Using FetchContent (building at configure time)

For now, the `CONFIGURATION_TYPES` of Nvidia PhysX are not default.
In order to "map" the standard CMake build/config types between a project and PhysX
we have to do extra work.
The following `CMake` gist configure and build PhysX using the variable `PHYSX_CONFIG_TYPE` (default to `release`)
to build PhysX with the chosen config type.
Also provides a install script to install PhysX with the project.
TODO(phcerdan): this installation script might require more flexibility and testing.
See [conversation](https://discourse.cmake.org/t/mapping-cmake-build-type-and-cmake-configuration-types-between-project-subdirectories/192/2)
that inspired this approach (thanks to @craig.scott)

## Introduction

Welcome to the NVIDIA PhysX SDK source code repository. This depot includes the PhysX SDK and the Kapla Demo application.

The NVIDIA PhysX SDK is a scalable multi-platform physics solution supporting a wide range of devices, from smartphones to high-end multicore CPUs and GPUs. PhysX is already integrated into some of the most popular game engines, including Unreal Engine, and Unity3D. [PhysX SDK on developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).

## Quick Start Instructions

Requirements:
* Python 2.7.6 or later
* CMake 3.12 or later

To begin, clone this repository onto your local drive.  Then change directory to physx/, run ./generate_projects.[bat|sh] and follow on-screen prompts.  This will let you select a platform specific solution to build.  You can then open the generated solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.

To build and run the Kapla Demo see [kaplademo/README.md](kaplademo/README.md).
