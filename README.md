## Introduction

Welcome to the NVIDIA PhysX SDK source code repository. This depot includes the PhysX SDK and the Kapla Demo application.

## Documentation

Please see physx/release_notes.html for updates pertaining to the latest update.  

The full set of documentation can also be found in the repository under physx/documentation or online at http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/simulation.html 

## Quick Start Instructions

To begin, clone this repository onto your local drive.  You will need to have Python 2.7.6 or later installed.  Then change directory to physx and run generate_projects.[bat|sh] at the command line and follow on-screen prompts.  This will let you select a platform specific solution to build.  You can then open the generated solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.

To build and run the Kapla Demo see kaplademo/README.md.
