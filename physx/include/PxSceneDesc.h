\brief Pruning structure used to accelerate scene queries.

eNONE uses a simple data structure that consumes less memory than the alternatives,
but generally has slower query performance.

eDYNAMIC_AABB_TREE usually provides the fastest queries. However there is a
constant per-frame management cost associated with this structure. How much work should
be done per frame can be tuned via the #PxSceneDesc::dynamicTreeRebuildRateHint
parameter.

eSTATIC_AABB_TREE is typically used for static objects. It is the same as the
dynamic AABB tree, without the per-frame overhead. This can be a good choice for static
objects, if no static objects are added, moved or removed after the scene has been
created. If there is no such guarantee (e.g. when streaming parts of the world in and out),
then the dynamic version is a better choice even for static objects.

\brief Scene query update mode

When PxScene::fetchResults is called it does scene query related work, with this enum it is possible to

FetchResults will sync changed bounds during simulation and update the scene query bounds in pruners, this work is mandatory.

eCOMMIT_ENABLED_BUILD_ENABLED does allow to execute the new AABB tree build step during fetchResults, additionally the pruner commit is
called where any changes are applied. During commit PhysX refits the dynamic scene query tree and if a new tree was built and 
the build finished the tree is swapped with current AABB tree. 

eCOMMIT_DISABLED_BUILD_ENABLED does allow to execute the new AABB tree build step during fetchResults. Pruner commit is not called,
this means that refit will then occur during the first scene query following fetchResults, or may be forced by the method PxScene::flushSceneQueryUpdates().

eCOMMIT_DISABLED_BUILD_DISABLED no further scene query work is executed. The scene queries update needs to be called manually, see PxScene::sceneQueriesUpdate.

\brief Enum for selecting the friction algorithm used for simulation.

#PxFrictionType::ePATCH selects the patch friction model which typically leads to the most stable results at low solver iteration counts and is also quite inexpensive, as it uses only
up to four scalar solver constraints per pair of touching objects.  The patch friction model is the same basic strong friction algorithm as PhysX 3.2 and before.  

#PxFrictionType::eONE_DIRECTIONAL is a simplification of the Coulomb friction model, in which the friction for a given point of contact is applied in the alternating tangent directions of
the contact's normal.  This simplification allows us to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence but is not as accurate as the two directional model.

#PxFrictionType::eTWO_DIRECTIONAL is identical to the one directional model, but it applies friction in both tangent directions simultaneously.  This hurts convergence a bit so it 
requires more solver iterations, but is more accurate.  Like the one directional model, it is applied at every contact point, which makes it potentially more expensive
than patch friction for scenarios with many contact points.

#PxFrictionType::eFRICTION_COUNT is the total numer of friction models supported by the SDK.

	/**
	\brief Setting to define the maximum number of 16K blocks that can be allocated to store contact, friction, and contact cache data.
	As the complexity of a scene increases, the SDK may require to allocate new 16k blocks in addition to the blocks it has already 
	allocated. This variable controls the maximum number of blocks that the SDK can allocate.

	In the case that the scene is sufficiently complex that all the permitted 16K blocks are used, contacts will be dropped and 
	a warning passed to the error stream.

	If a warning is reported to the error stream to indicate the number of 16K blocks is insufficient for the scene complexity 
	then the choices are either (i) re-tune the number of 16K data blocks until a number is found that is sufficient for the scene complexity,
	(ii) to simplify the scene or (iii) to opt to not increase the memory requirements of physx and accept some dropped contacts.

	\brief The maximum bias coefficient used in the constraint solver

	When geometric errors are found in the constraint solver, either as a result of shapes penetrating
	or joints becoming separated or violating limits, a bias is introduced in the solver position iterations
	to correct these errors. This bias is proportional to 1/dt, meaning that the bias becomes increasingly 
	strong as the time-step passed to PxScene::simulate(...) becomes smaller. This coefficient allows the
	application to restrict how large the bias coefficient is, to reduce how violent error corrections are.
	This can improve simulation quality in cases where either variable time-steps or extremely small time-steps
	are used.
